//You are working on a web application for a car rental company. They want to keep track
//of their car inventory and rental information. Your task is to create a JavaScript class or
//function constructor for representing cars in their inventory and another one for
//representing rental information.


//Requirements:
// 1) Create a Car class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// a. make (string): The make of the car, e.g., "Toyota".
// b. model (string): The model of the car, e.g., "Camry".
// c. year (number): The year the car was manufactured, e.g., 2020.
// d. isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the car is currently available for rent.
// The Car class or function constructor should also have a method called
// toggleAvailability that changes the isAvailable property to its opposite value (true to
// false, false to true)


class Car{
    constructor(make,model,year ){

    this.model=model
    this.make=model
    this.year= year
    this.isAvailable=this.isAvailable
    }
    toggledAvailability(){
        this.toggledAvailability!==this.toggledAvailability
    }
   

};
console.log(car)
let Car=newCar("Toyota","camry",2020)
